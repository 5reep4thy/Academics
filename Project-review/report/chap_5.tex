The proposed model can be adjusted to support any number of labels at the output. So we can make it work for various other tasks such as question answering, sentiment analysis etc, given we have an appropriate dataset to fine tune the model on. Since the Macaw encoder is pre-trained on tasks involving general reasoning, it can be expected to work reasonably well in many of the tasks.
